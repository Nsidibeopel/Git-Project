Initializing a Git Repository

To initialize a git repository, I used the commands below:

Step 1. Create a directory using the command: mkdir JoanDevOps-Project'

Step 2. Change to the directory created using the command: cd JoanDevOps-Project\

Step 3. While inside the folder, run the command 'git init' to initialize the repo

Please take a look at the screenshot below.

Making a Commit

To make a commit is to save changes, for example, adding, modifying or deleting a file. 

When the command is run, it takes a snapshot of the current state of the repository and saves it to the .git folder inside the working directory.

Here are the steps to make a commit on Git

Step 1. Create a file named idex.txt

Step 2. Add a text "My First Git Commit" to the file created using the following command

echo "My First Git Commit" > index.txt

Step 3. Use the command 'git add .' to update or add the changes to the repository.

Step 4. Finally, commit the changes to git, run the command git commit -m "First Commit"

Please take a look at the screenshot below.
